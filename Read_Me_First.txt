# ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ Labour Force Segmentation Analysis â€“ Canada (2014â€“2024)

###  Machine Learning + Power BI Project | By Guru Prasad Srinivasan

This project analyzes the Canadian Labour Force Survey (LFS) data from 2014â€“2024 to uncover workforce segments using KMeans clustering and visualizes employment trends using Power BI. It combines Python-based machine learning with professional BI storytelling, offering policy-level insights into underemployment, wage disparity, and regional labour dynamics.

---

##  Objectives

- Cluster the Canadian workforce based on weekly earnings, hours worked, education, and demographics.
- Identify hidden patterns of underemployment and low-efficiency labour segments.
- Visualize insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard with 7 drill-down pages.
- Showcase end-to-end data science and BI pipeline for portfolio and job applications.

##  Dataset

- **Source:** Statistics Canada - Labour Force Survey (2014â€“2024)
- **Size:** 100,000+ records | 70+ columns
- **Preprocessing:** Removed 2011 and 2025, dropped >50% null columns, mapped age and education groups, handled outliers using Z-score/IQR.

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Languages:** Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Seaborn)
- **Visualization:** Power BI (DAX, Slicers, Drill-through)
- **Other Tools:** Excel (Pivot Tables, Data Cleaning)

---

##  Methodology

### 1. **Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**
- Mapped career stages (0â€“8 years, Mid, Late, etc.)
- Segmented weekly earnings into quantiles (`EARN_GROUP`)
- Calculated **Efficiency Index** = Weekly Earnings / Weekly Hours

### 2. **Clustering (Unsupervised Learning)**
- **Model:** KMeans (K=9)
- **Scaler:** StandardScaler
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** PCA and t-SNE
- **Interpretation:** Cluster profiling by education, hours, and wage

### 3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**
- Cluster distribution by province, gender, education, and earnings
- Created summary tables using Excel Pivot
- Derived provincial efficiency indexes

## ðŸ“ˆ Power BI Dashboard (7 Pages)

1. **Workforce by Career Stage**
2. **Earnings vs Hours by Cluster**
3. **Cluster Demographics (Age, Gender)**
4. **Education vs Clusters**
5. **Province-wise Cluster Spread**
6. **Earning Group Segments**
7. **Cluster Drill-Through Explorer**

Each page includes slicers, tooltips, and interactive visuals.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Findings

- **Cluster 0 & 2**: High-earning, highly educated, efficient segments.
- **Cluster 6**: Underemployed group with lowest hours and efficiency.
- **Clusters 7 & 8**: "Working poor" â€” vulnerable segments with low wages.
- **Geographic Gaps**: PEI, NL show structural underemployment.
- **Education Alignment**: Bachelor's/Grad degrees dominate high-value clusters.

- Government policy planning for labour support
- Employment agency job-matching systems
- Education-to-wage alignment analytics
- Resume-ready portfolio and Power BI visualization
